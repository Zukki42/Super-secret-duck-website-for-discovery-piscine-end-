        <h2>Eddie the yappiest Duck</h2>
        <p>
          Also known as the yappiest duck in the pond, this duck is the brains behind the website.
          He also hates it when people call him a short duckâ€¦ (he is not that short) ((he is tall for a duck)).
          Never presented anything before, so he wants to apologise if this isnâ€™t as amazing as others would have done it.

        <h2>Vikky the motivator Duck</h2>
        <p>
          Known as the Polish duck, this duck is the main motivator of the website.
          She should have been up here presenting this website with me, but she is lowkey evil and didnâ€™t want to comeâ€¦
          She also feeds the other ducks in the pond with bread crumbs and is a great team player. 
          Thank you for everything you do for us all!
